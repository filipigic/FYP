# Quantum Autoencoders for Efficient Image Compression
---
My Final Year Project at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/).  
The project explores compressing images represented as quantum states with as little qubits as possible.  
For development, the following tools were used:

* [Anaconda (Python)](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

The repo contains the [code](./code), [thesis report](./Thesis.pdf) and [viva presentation](./Viva.pptx).
